Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.


'''
#inp =  (input( " Enter coma separated binary "))
inp = '0100,0011,1010,1001'
arr = inp.split(",")
#arr = list(map(int , arr))
for item in arr:
    l=int(item,2)
    if l%5==0:
        print(item)

        '''
        Solution:
value = []
items=[x for x in raw_input().split(',')]
for p in items:
    intp = int(p, 2)
    if not intp%5:
        value.append(p)

print ','.join(value)
